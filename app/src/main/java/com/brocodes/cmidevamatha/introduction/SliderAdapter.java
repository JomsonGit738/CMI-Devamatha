He was declared as Servant of God by Mar Poly Kannookadan, the Bishop of Syro-Malabar Catholic Diocese of Irinjalakuda.", "The Carmelites of Mary Immaculate(C.M.I.) is a clerical religious congregation of Pontifical Right for men of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, and is the largest clerical religious congregation of pontifical right in the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church. The core charism of congregation is contemplata et aliis tradere (to share with others the fruits of contemplation). The Identity and heritage of the Congregation is reflected in its triple roots of spirituality namely Indian, Eastern and Carmelite. The Congregation is involved in pastoral works consisting of teaching at all levels, taking care of aged and sick, apostolate of press, running several mission dioceses both in India and abroad as Global Mission."};
